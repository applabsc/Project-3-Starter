#  Project 3: Navigation

In this project we're going to incorporate what we've learned to build a combination to-do/weather app. We're going be building upon the login screen, and weather app and the to-do app that we made previously by adding navigation functionalities. The starter code for this project already has the three screens implemented, so don't worry about copying the code you already have into this starter project.

For this project, using a third party library, [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/en/), to handle navigation.

## Project Structure
* The code for the three screens that we're going to be linking are all in the screens folder
* App.js will hold the code that we'll write to handle navigation. For this project this is the only file that you'll need to edit.

## Getting Started
* Clone this repository to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/applabsc/Project-3-Starter.git`
* `cd` into `Project-3-Starter`
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm install --save react-navigation` to install the navigation library that we'll need
* Open `App.js`. Instead of writing code to create a component, we're going to be writing code to initialize the navigation structure of our app.
